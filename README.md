<b> My Process</b>
First I designed the site using a simple template. I then picked some of my favourite colours for the headings in my stylesheet. Then I decided how I wanted to group my images together based on categories - My Family & Friends, My Trips, My Milestones - as these seemed the most interesting areas to show any readers of the page. Lastly, I wrote my bio based on the main facts about myself that I found interesting and included links to my Linkedin and email in a contact section that I put in on the right-hand side of the page. 

<b>Our Brief:</b>
The work submitted has the changes requested to the site based on the brief given to us with the follow Directions.
